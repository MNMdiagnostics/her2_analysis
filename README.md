HER2 status
==============================

This is a repository dedicated for the code used to obtain the results reported in the paper: Validation of HER2 status in whole genome sequencing data of breast cancers with AI-driven, ploidy-corrected approach.

The main results can be found in the [readme report](reports/readme.md) while all the details of the analysis with the code allowing to reproduce all of our results can be found in the [notebooks](notebooks).

## Feedback
We aim to gather the feedback about the input data and the outcome received by other researchers using our tool.
We have added a kind request to notify us about any such results and included [a short feedback questionnaire](documents/questionnaire.pdf) as a form of a peer review.
